# JavaScript Placement Prep 🚀

**For 3rd Year Engineering & Science Students**

This repository is designed to be your **last-minute revision guide** and **coding practice hub** for JavaScript interviews. It focuses on the core concepts asked in placement interviews for Front-End (React) and Back-End (Node.js) roles.

## 🎯 **Who is this for?**
- Students preparing for **Internships & Placements**.
- Developers moving from C++/Java to **Modern JavaScript**.
- Anyone needing to clear **Technical Rounds**.

## 📚 **Topics Covered**
1. **Variables & Scope**: `let` vs `var`, Hoisting, TDZ.
2. **Functions**: Closures, Lexical Scope, Arrow Functions.
3. **Modern JS**: Destructuring, Template Literals, ES6+ features.
4. **Async JS**: Callbacks, Promises, Async/Await, Event Loop.
5. **Mini Projects**: Practical application of concepts.

## 🛠️ **How to Study**
1. **Core Learning**: Go to the `core/` folder to study concepts (Read-Only).
2. **Student Submission**: Create your own folder in `students/` (e.g., `students/rahul-123`).
3. **Practice**: Copy mini-projects or assignments into your folder to work on them.
4. **Interview Prep**: Read `INTERVIEW-NOTES.md` before coding.

## 💡 **Interview Focus**
- Don't just memorize syntax. Understand **how** JS works under the hood.
- Be ready to explain **event loop** and **closures** on a whiteboard.

Happy Coding & Good Luck for Placements! 🎓
